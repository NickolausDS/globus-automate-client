Development
-----------

-   Update click to version 8.0.4.
    This resolves a security issue.
-   Update typer to version 0.4.1.
-   Update scriv to version 0.14.0.
    scriv is a development dependency.
-   Temporarily remove typer-cli as a listed development dependency.
    It is still needed when generating the CLI documentation.
-   Add safety as a test environment for local and CI testing.
