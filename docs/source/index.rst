Globus Automate - CLI and Python SDK
====================================

This is an experimental, and unsupported interface for working with Globus
Automate tools, notably the Globus Flows service and any service implementing
the Action Provider Interface.

As this is experimental, no support is implied or provided for any sort of use
of this package. It is published for ease of distribution among those planning
to use it for its intended, experimental, purpose.
